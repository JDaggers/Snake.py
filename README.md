## SNAKE

Its a super simple snake game that runs in the terminal.
I made it to learn the basics of ANSI terminals.

Annoyingly the snake moves faster vertically than horizontally naturally, 
because of the aspect ratio of the font of the terminal. I have tried to
offset this by altering the framerate when the snake is travelling vertically.
However I have been unable to find a way to determine the aspect ratio setting 
of the terminals font from inside an ANSI program.
